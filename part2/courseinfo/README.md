# Courseinfo

The web application aims to implement a web application for collecting customer feedback.

Some statistics are displayed in an HTML table once feedback has been gathered:
- the total number of collected feedback,
- the average score (good: 1, neutral: 0, bad: -1) and
- the percentage of positive feedback.

The `reduce` array method was used to calculate the total of exercises.

The application was extended to allow an arbitrary number of courses by using the `map` array method.

The Course component was included as a separate module.
