# Phonebook

The web application aims to create a simple phonebook.

If the person's information is already in the phonebook, the application will display a dialog where the user can confirm whether to replace the old number with the new number.

A search field was implemented to allow users to filter the list of people by name.

The `toLowerCase()` method was used in the *search* and *name* variables to convert those values to lower case. This allow us to apply a case-insensitive filtering logic.

The phonebook data is stored in the *db.json* file located at the root of the proyect. The *json-server* package is used to simulate fetching data from a server during the development phase.

The following script was added to the *package.json* to start the json-server.

```json
"server": "json-server -p3001 --watch db.json"
```

The code that handles the communication with the backend was extracted into its own module `./src/services/person.jsËš`.
